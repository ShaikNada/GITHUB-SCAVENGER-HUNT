# GITHUB-SCAVENGER-HUNT
You are a coder, working late into the night on a new project. Suddenly, something strange happens. Your code begins to come to life, twisting and shifting as if it has a mind of its own. Before you know it, the code manifests into a monstrous, monstrous beingâ€”a terrifying Code Monster.

The monster is relentless and is determined to destroy everything you've worked on. It hunts you down through your files, growing more powerful the longer you struggle. The only way to survive is to escape. But the path ahead is perilous, filled with coding challenges that only a skilled programmer can navigate. The Code Monster is right behind you, and each choice you make could be your last.

# Your Mission:
You must race through the levels of your GitHub repository, solving coding puzzles, choosing the right paths, and using Git commands to unlock your escape route. With each passing level, you will face increasingly difficult challenges, and the Code Monster is getting closer. Can you outrun it?
